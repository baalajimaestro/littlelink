# üîó LittleLink

![LittleLink](https://cdn.cottle.cloud/littlelink/social-circle.png)

LittleLink is a lightweight DIY alternative to services like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee)
and [many.link](https://many.link/). LittleLink was built using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), a dead simple, responsive boilerplate‚Äîwe just stripped out some additional code you wouldn't need and added in branded styles for popular services. üòä

![Themes](https://cdn.cottle.cloud/littlelink/littlelink-comparison.gif)

LittleLink has more than 50+ branded button styles you can use (with even more being added by our community). You'll also find a light and dark theme ready to go. Not a fan of the default colors? Update `skeleton-light.css` or `skeleton-dark.css` to the HEX values of your choosing. You can also set your CSS to `skeleton-auto.css`, which will use the system theme of the device you visit on.

![Performance](https://cdn.cottle.cloud/littlelink/performance.png)

Using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) let us build something that loads quickly & doesn't have any of the unnecessary bloat you would get from using a large framework for a page that requires nothing more than simplicity. LittleLink scored a 99/100 in performance when tested with [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse).

![Publish](https://cdn.cottle.cloud/littlelink/fork-edit-publish.png)

No need for gulp, npm, or anything else to make LittleLink work‚Äîit uses the bare essentials. You can automatically fork and deploy LittleLink with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Enjoy free and fast hosting with automatic deployments on every branch push with one click below. üëáÔ∏è
