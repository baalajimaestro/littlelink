LittleLink has more than 100 branded button styles you can use (with even more being added by our community). You'll also find a light and dark theme ready to go. Not a fan of the default colors? Update `skeleton-light.css` or `skeleton-dark.css` to the HEX values of your choosing. You can also set your CSS to `skeleton-auto.css`, which will use the system theme of the device you visit on.

![Performance](https://cdn.cottle.cloud/littlelink/Lighthouse.svg)

Using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) let us build something that loads quickly & doesn't have any of the unnecessary bloat you would get from using a large framework for a page that requires nothing more than simplicity. LittleLink scored a 99/100 in performance when tested with [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse).

![Publish](https://cdn.cottle.cloud/littlelink/Publish.svg)
